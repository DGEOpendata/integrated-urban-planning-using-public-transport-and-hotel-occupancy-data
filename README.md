# Integrated Urban Planning Using Public Transport and Hotel Occupancy Data

## Overview
This project aims to integrate datasets on public transportation usage and hotel occupancy in Abu Dhabi to support comprehensive urban planning. By analyzing these datasets together, urban planners can optimize infrastructure and services to enhance the urban experience for both residents and tourists.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Pandas library
- Datasets: `Abu_Dhabi_Public_Transport_Usage_2018_2024.csv` and `Abu_Dhabi_Hotels_Open_Datasets1_0.xlsx`

## Installation
1. Ensure Python is installed on your system. Download from [Python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/) if necessary.
2. Install Pandas library using pip:
   bash
   pip install pandas
   

## Usage
1. Download the datasets and place them in your project directory.
2. Use the provided Python script to load and process the data.
3. The script will output a combined dataset showing correlations between hotel occupancy and transport usage by season.

## Example
The example script provided loads the datasets, processes them to identify peak seasons for hotel occupancy, and correlates these with public transport usage. The resulting insights can guide urban planning decisions.
